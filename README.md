You can also create a new collection by clicking the 'Create Collection' button.

## Note
To list collections, visit 'http://localhost:3000/api/collections' in your browser.

To list collections by id, visit 'http://localhost:3000/api/collections/[id]' in your browser.
(replace id wtih the collection id in question)
